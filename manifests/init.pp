#   Defaults to true.
#
# [*groups*]
#   An array of additional groups to add the user to.
#   Defaults to an empty array.
#
# [*system*]
#   Whether the user is a "system" user or not.
#   Defaults to false.
#
# [*ssh_key*]
#   A string containing a public key suitable for SSH logins
#   If set to 'undef', no key will be created.
#   Defaults to undef.
#
# [*ssh_key_type*]
#   The type of SSH key to manage. Accepts any value accepted by
#   the ssh_authorized_key's 'type' parameter.
#   Defaults to 'ssh-rsa'.
